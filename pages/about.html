        <p>I'm Abid Azad and I'm currently an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in 
          the field of embedded systems and circuit design. More specificaly, I am exploring a wide range of diverse skills set which include 
          tinkering with AutoCAD, STM32 microcontroller, learning Altium, and understanding the essential components that make up electronic systems.

        <h1>Growing Up</h1>

      <div class="about-text">
        <p>I was raised in Toronto, surrounded by an ample amount of diversity and new experiences. Growing up, I was always passionated by electronics starting
          from my childhood where I would always play video games. Some games required higher end specifications. Thus I got invested in building mmy own computer and switching out the GPU, CPU, or RAM. 
          And in gaming you need every competitive thus I was very invested in electronic aspect. But it was in Grade 10/11 where I was truly introduced
          to embedded systems. In the robotics club was the very first time I saw a miniature self-driving car. I was very fascinated by the fact 
          machinaries can do automated processes by the use of sensors. This in turn guided me to the path of Electrical Engineering.
